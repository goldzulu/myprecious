# My Precious Web3 Voice Wallet Alexa Skill

My Precious Web3 Voice Wallet Alexa Skill is a voice wallet for Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. A Web3 Voice Wallet that can be operated by voice anytime and anywhere via Amazon Alexa.

There are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices out there and many times more users per device.  The vision is to onboard as many Alexa voice users out there to the web3 world effortlessly.

Voice brings the ease and convenience of accessing information the web3 and defi world. Upon further development, you can say things below to My Precious:

- "Alexa, check my wallet balance" or
- "Alexa, notify me when my a new transaction occurs on my wallet"
- "Alexa, what is the total value of my tokens in US dollars?"
- "Alexa, read me my last transaction"

and many more.

You can use this at home or even on the move in the car, etc!

Also hoping to in the future allow voice personalisation i.e. only respond if the voice is recognized, e.g. if you ask for a balance, your balance will be spoken and if your partner ask, it will be their balance. `If anyone else ask, then they will not get a balance.

Some fun things that will be also built
"Alexa, What is Paris Hilton's wallet balance?" and other fun facts!
